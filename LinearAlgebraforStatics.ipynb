    "Welcome to LinearAlgebraforStatics!\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "This is a notebook to learn how to use linear algebra<sup>3</sup> to help solve common problems you see in physics and statics. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows us to think about linear equations in different ways and is helpful to us, as a physicists and engineers because we can solve for many unknowns at one time through matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Systems with Matrices**\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "Matrices are a tool in linear algebra that can be used to represent and manipulate systems of linear equations (linear systems). Matrices are collection of numbers that are arranged in arrays, like tables in a rectangular format enclosed by brackets. Specifically, we will use matrices to represent and solve linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Systems must be in this form to solve:  \n",
    "$ x - y + z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ -x + y - z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ 10y + 25z = 90 $  \n",
    "$ 20x + 10y = 80 $  \n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; Notice that the equations are organized with variables with their **coefficients on one side and constants on the other**. A coefficient is the number that come before the variable that multiply that specific variable, for example $10$ in $10y$ and $25$ in $25z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this system represented in a couple of different kinds of matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 & 90 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 & 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This first matrix is called an augmented matrix. Augmented matrices contain the **coefficients of the variables for each variable and what the expressions are equal to (the constants)**. The rows hold each equation and columns hold each coefficient. So, the first equation's coefficients and constant $(x - y + z = 0)$ are held in the first row as $(1, -1, 1, 0)$. Additionally, you will notice that the first column holds the x coefficient, the second the y coefficient, and the third the z coefficient and this format is continued for the entirety of the matrix. Further note that the third row begins with a 0 because there is no x variable in that equation. The rows are concluded by a 0, 0, 90 and 80, the constants the expressions are equal to. It is standard that the last column (the right most column) holds the constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This second matrix is a coefficient matrix of size 4 by 3 (rows by columns). A coefficient matrix is a matrix that **solely holds the coefficients of the variables in the equation**. Notice that the rows hold each equation and columns hold each coefficient again. We also can categorize this matrix by its shape and call it a rectangular matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 90 \\\\ 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The third matrix is a special kind of matrix called a vector. We call the matrix a vector because it has a singular row (also can have a singular column instead). Notice that **this matrix is all of the constants separated off the augmented matrix shown earlier**. We will use this technique in our coding as well and will call them \"constant\" vectors for the purposes of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will only use coefficient matrices and constant vectors because that is what the code requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, here is an example of how the above augmented matrix would look in Python:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1, -1, 1 , 0], [-1, 1, -1, 0], [0, 10, 25, 90], [20, 10, 0, 80]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each row is confined in brackets `[]` and each row is separated from another row by a comma. The whole matrix is enclosed by its own brackets `[]`. Brackets in python denotes a list and when there is a list inside of another list it is called a nested list. In our code, we will be transforming these nested lists into arrays, so there will be multiple lists of the same length inside arrays (so in tabular form it looks like a uniform rectangle without any sections missing). Arrays are also easier to do arithmetic on compared to lists. We will see how we will use this in our code in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's learn about the code for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code**\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "We will go through the code line by line so you get basic terminology and understand how the program is structured."

So, we will use the numpy library's routine called linalg to make changes to it by the lstsq method on the object of class numpy array. The general syntax is `library.routine.method()`. Lstsq stands for the least squares method and an example of a method buried in a routine from a library. A method is a collection of code that makes changes or refers to an object. The difference between methods and functions is purely in their purpose. Methods deal with objects while functions are more generally a collection of code that does anything. The lstsq method takes many parameters, including `coemat` and `vecmat`. The lstsq method also takes a number of optional parameters which are set to None automatically if not provided. We provided an example of this above when we set `rcond=None`. None in Python is like `null` in other programming languages. This method returns a list of useful data. For our purposes, the answer to the system is put in the first entry of the list. We access and print it on the next line by `sol[0]`. In lists and arrays we count each object starting at 0, which is why we have `sol[0]` written. So, we print to the screen `\"The answer is:\"`, `sol[0]` (the answer) and `Done`."

    "Now we know about matrices and the code, lets look at a familiar example to get us acquainted with the code and entering variables and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1 - Physics:\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Let's look at an example of a problem<sup>1</sup> from Workshop Physics I. We will walk you through this first problem and show you entering everything first:\n",
    "<img src=\"ex1physics.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Example 1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose:* The purpose of this problem is to find the acceleration of the system ($a$) and the tension in the string between block A and block B ($T_1$) and between block B and block C ($T_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given:* We are given the tension in string being pulled on ($T_3 = 65N$) and the mass of each block ($m_A = 12kg$, $m_B = 24kg$, $m_C = 31kg$). We are also told that the floor is horizontal which means it is level and that the floor is frictionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions:* Some things we need to assume are the strings are connected in the center of the blocks to prevent them from tipping over and that the strings will not break or come loose from the blocks. We also assume that tension forces are solely in the x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution:* First, we will set up the equations and then we will explain how to enter it into the program. To do this problem, we need to look at the forces on each mass separately and write force equations for each mass in the horizontal direction (which we will call the x direction with positive point to the right). We only need to work with the forces in the x direction because we assume the tension forces are solely in the x direction and we are only interested in how much the blocks accelerate in the x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Block A:  \n",
    "Since block A is on the end, in the x direction in its Free Body Diagram (FBD) the block only has the tension force going to the right. We write this force equation:  \n",
    "$(m_A)a = T_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Block B:  \n",
    "Since block B is in the middle of 2 blocks, in the x direction of its FBD there will be 2 tension forces, one going to the left and one to the right. The force going to the left is $T_1$ and the force going to the right is $T_2$. We write this force equation:  \n",
    "$(m_B)a = T_2 - T_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Block C:  \n",
    "Since block C is also in the middle of 2 blocks, it will have the same FBD as block b with 2 tension forces going to the left and the right. The force going to the left is $T_2$ and the force going to the right is $T_3$. We write this force equation:  \n",

    "$(24kg)a + T_1 - T_2 = 0$  \n",
    "$(31kg)a + T_2 = 65N$\n",
