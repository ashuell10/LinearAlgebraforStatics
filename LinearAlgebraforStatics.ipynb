    "Welcome to LinearAlgebraforStatics!\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "This is a basic notebook to learn how to use linear algebra to help solve common problems you see in physics. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows us to think about linear equations in different ways and  specifically is helpful to us, as a physicists and engineers because we can solve for many unknowns at one time. First, let's learn about what matrices are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Systems with Matrices**\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "Matrices are a tool in linear algebra that can be used to represent and manipulate linear systems. Matrices are collection of numbers that are arranged in arrays, like tables in a rectangle format enclosed by brackets. Specifically, we will use matrices to represent and solve linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Systems must be in this form to solve:  \n",
    "$ x - y + z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ -x + y - z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ 10y + 25z = 90 $  \n",
    "$ 20x + 10y = 80 $  \n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; Notice that the equations have solely variables with their coefficients on one side and constants on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this system represented in a couple of different kinds of matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 & 90 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 & 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This first matrix is called an augmented matrix. Augmented matrices contain the coefficients of the variables for each equation in order of variable name and what the expressions are equal to (constants). So, if you make the first column the x coefficient, the second the y coefficient, and the third the z coefficient, then you must keep the matrix in that format for the entirety of the matrix. We can see this by looking at the first row that contains 1, -1 and 1 because x, y, and z have coefficients of 1. Then, the second row contains -1, 1, -1 in relation to x, y, and z. Both rows are concluded by a 0 because that is the constant the expressions are equal to. Note that the third row begins with a 0 because there is no x variable in that equation. It is standard that the last column holds the constants. Augmented Matrices are most commonly used to represent linear systems, since augmented matrices have the power to hold both the coefficients and the constants but because of the code we are using, we will have to represent linear systems in a different way which will be explained soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This second matrix is a coefficient matrix of size 4 by 3 (rows by columns). A coefficient matrix is a matrix that solely holds the coefficients of the variables in the equation. We also can categorize this matrix by its shape and call it a rectangular matrix. Similarly, if it was say for example a 3 by 3 matrix, we could call it a square matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 90 \\\\ 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The third matrix is a special kind of matrix called a vector. We call the matrix a vector because it has a singular row (also can have a singular column instead). Note that this matrix is all of the constants broken off of the augmented matrix, but in general does not have to be. We will use this technique in our coding as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will use coefficient matrices and \"constant\" vectors because that is what the code requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, here is an example of how matrices will look printed from the library we will use in Python:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "[[ 1 -1  1  0]\n",
    " [-1  1 -1  0]\n",
    " [ 0 10 25 90]\n",
    " [20 10  0 80]]\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Now, lets learn about the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code**\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "Let's go through the code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`import numpy as np`: This is called an import statement. Python comes with a certain range of knowledge which we can extend by importing libraries. Libraries are a collection of knowledge that we can reference so we do not need to code it ourselves. Libraries are a way that we can share knowledge with other coders. Numpy is a well known library to do scientific computing. We import it `as np` basically to give it an alias, so in code we do not have to keep typing out numpy in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "`coemat = np.array([])`  \n",
    "`vecmat = np.array([])`: These statements are called assignment statements. In python, we also initialize variables in assignment statements. Here, we are setting each of our variables `coemat` and `vecmat` to numpy \"styled\" arrays. `np.array([])` will `return` an array that will be written by the user. The basic format for these dot operations is the library the method comes from and then the method you would like to access (`library.method()`). A method (or function) is a collection of code in a program that is stored in one place that you can make references to the method. The advantage of writing methods in your code is so you can reuse your code as many times as you want so you do not need to keep writing it over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(coemat)`  \n",
    "`print(vecmat)`: These are called print statements. After you enter your arrays, these statements are printed so you can see your arrays in the format you saw above. These are added for ease for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sol = np.linalg.lstsq(coemat, vecmat)`  \n",
    "`print(sol[0])`  \n",
    "`print(Done)`: The first line is another assignment statement. You will see we access the numpy library again and use a method from the routine linalg called lstsq. This stands for the least squares method and an example of a method buried in a routine from a library. The general syntax looks like this `library.routine.method()`. This method returns a list (in a form of a `type` `list` in python) of useful data. For our purposes, the answer to the system is put in the first entry of the list. We print and access it on the next line. In lists and arrays we count each object starting at 0, which is why we have `sol[0]` written. Finally, we print `Done` to indicate to the user that the program is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know about matrices and the code, lets look at a familiar example to get us acquainted with the code and the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Let's look at an example of a problem we can use linear algebra from Workshop Physics I:\n",
    "<img src=\"physics.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Example\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this question is to write 2 force equations that will allow you to solve for the 2 unknowns. The key to do this problem is that we can make both $\\sum_{}^{}F_x$ and $\\sum_{}^{}F_y$ equal to 0 because the crate is not accelerating on the ramp in any direction (so there is no net force on the crate). It is also helpful to use a standard coordinate system since the applied and the force of gravity would be entirely in the x and y direction respectively in these coordinates, so we only need to break the normal force into its components. Attempt to write down the 2 force equations needed to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get\n",
    "$\\sum_{}^{}F_x = F - N_x$ and $\\sum_{}^{}F_y = N_y - G$ where F = applied force, N = normal force, G = gravitational force\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, usually you would solve the $\\sum_{}^{}F_y$ first for N and then solve the $\\sum_{}^{}F_x$ for the F. But, we can do this in one step with matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is to look at the values of $cos(30$&deg;$)$, $sin(30$&deg;$)$ and G as coefficients, keeping F and N as unknowns. Here is what you are left with:\n",
    "$\\sum_{}^{}F_x = F - .5N$ and $\\sum_{}^{}F_y = .87N - 980$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, knowing $\\sum_{}^{}F_x$ and $\\sum_{}^{}F_y$ are both 0 we can write the equations like this:\n",
    "$0 = F - .5N$ and $980 = .87N$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this seems silly since we can solve very easily for N in the 2nd equation but for the purposes of our learning we can easily check our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we have our system we must write it in the form of a matrix. For a coefficient matrix, we have 2 variables and 2 equations so we will have 2 columns and 2 rows. Here is our coefficient matrix with F as the first variable:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1, .5],\n",
    " [0, -.866]]\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Then, our constant vector should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[0],\n",
    " [980]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first example, we have entered in the number for you. Scroll down past the code in the cell to see what you get."

    "Congratulations! You have run your first program. Lets look at another example in Statics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "In statics, one way we can use matrices when we are solving for forces in a structures using the joints method, which you will learn about in more detail later in the year. From *Engineering Mechanics: Statics*<sup>2</sup>, here is problem about a signboard where we are asked to find the force in members BE and BC when the horizontal wind load is 712 lb. Specifically 5/8 of the force is transmitted to the center connection at C and the rest is equally divided between D and B.\n",
    "<img src=\"Statics.jpg\" alt=\"Statics Example\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of solving each joint explicitly, we can leave the equations unsolved and put the equations in a system. First we can solve for the $D_x$ and $C_x$ since we are given their values in fractional form. We find that $D_x$ = 133.5lb, $C_x$ = 445lb. There are also some forces that you can solve very simply (they are the only countering force in a certain direction) and I put in their values explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For learning purposes, let's go through each joint so you can start seeing the process to solve structures by the joints method. You do not need to know how to do these problems, but we can practice entering their values into the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "From joint D, you get the equations:  \n",
    "$ 133.5 = .4961DE $  \n",
    "$ 0 = .8682DE - CD $\n",
    "\n",
    "From joint C, you get the equation:  \n",
    "$ 0 = CD - BC $\n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; From this joint you also will find CE = 445 T\n",
    "\n",
    "From joint E, you get the equations:\n",
