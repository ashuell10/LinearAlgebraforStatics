    "Welcome to LinearAlgebraforStatics!\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "This is a notebook to learn how to use linear algebra<sup>3</sup> to help solve common problems you see in physics and statics. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows us to think about linear equations in different ways and is helpful to us, as a physicists and engineers because we can solve for many unknowns at one time through matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Systems with Matrices**\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "Matrices are a tool in linear algebra that can be used to represent and manipulate systems of linear equations (linear systems). Matrices are collection of numbers that are arranged in arrays, like tables in a rectangle format enclosed by brackets. Specifically, we will use matrices to represent and solve linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Systems must be in this form to solve:  \n",
    "$ x - y + z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ -x + y - z = 0 $  \n",
    "$ 10y + 25z = 90 $  \n",
    "$ 20x + 10y = 80 $  \n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; Notice that the equations are organized with variables with their **coefficients on one side and constants on the other**. Coefficients are the numbers that come before the variables that multiply that variables, for example $10$ in $10y$ and $25$ in $25z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this system represented in a couple of different kinds of matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 & 90 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 & 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This first matrix is called an augmented matrix. Augmented matrices contain the **coefficients of the variables for each variable and what the expressions are equal to (the constants)**. The rows hold each equation and columns hold each coefficient. So, the first equation's coefficients and constant ($ x - y + z = 0 $) are held in the first row ($1, -1, 1, 0$). Additionally, you will notice that the first column holds the x coefficient, the second the y coefficient, and the third the z coefficient and this format is continued for the entirety of the matrix. Further note that the third row begins with a 0 because there is no x variable in that equation. The rows are concluded by a 0, 0 and 90, the constants the expressions are equal to. It is standard that the last column (the right most column) holds the constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 10 & 25 \\\\ 20 & 10 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This second matrix is a coefficient matrix of size 4 by 3 (rows by columns). A coefficient matrix is a matrix that **solely holds the coefficients of the variables in the equation**. Notice that the rows hold each equation and columns hold each coefficient again. We also can categorize this matrix by its shape and call it a rectangular matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 90 \\\\ 80 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The third matrix is a special kind of matrix called a vector. We call the matrix a vector because it has a singular row (also can have a singular column instead). Notice that **this matrix is all of the constants separated off the augmented matrix shown earlier**. We will use this technique in our coding as well and will call them \"constant\" vectors for the purposes of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will solely use coefficient matrices and constant vectors because that is what the code requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, here is an example of how matrices will look like in Python:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1, -1, 1 , 0], [-1, 1, -1, 0], [0, 10, 25, 90], [20, 10, 0, 80]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each row is confined in brackets `[]` and each row is separated from another row by a comma. The whole matrix is enclosed by its own brackets `[]`. Brackets in python denotes a list or an array. When there is a list or array inside of another list or array it is called a nested list or a nested array (or 2D array). For coding purposes, we will simply call them arrays. We will be entering matrices by this method in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's learn about the code for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Code**\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "We will go through the code line by line so you get basic terminology and understand how the program is structured."

    "The first line is another example of an assignment statement. You will see we access the numpy library again and use a method from linalg called lstsq. This stands for the least squares method and an example of a method buried in a routine from a library. A method is a collection of code that is stored in class. Classes define, in code, a certain kind of object and methods make changes to or accesses that kind of object. So, we will use the numpy library's routine called linalg to make changes to it by the lstsq method on the object of class numpy array. The general syntax is `library.routine.method()`. This method takes many parameters, including the coefficient matrix (coemat) and the constant matrix (vecmat). This method also takes a number of other parameters which are set to None automatically. We provided an example of this above when we set `rcond=None`. None in Python is like `null` in other programming languages. This method `return`s or outputs an array of useful data. For our purposes, the answer to the system is put in the first entry of the list. We access and print it on the next line by `sol[0]`. In lists and arrays we count each object starting at 0, which is why we have `sol[0]` written. So, we print to the screen `\"The answer is:\"`, `sol[0]` and `Done`."

    "----------------\n",
    "Let's look at an example of a problem<sup>1</sup> from Workshop Physics I. We will walk you through this first problem and show you how to use the program first:\n",
    "<img src=\"ex1physics.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Example 1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose:* The purpose of this problem is to find the acceleration of the system (a) and the tension in the string between block A and block B ($T_1$) and in the string between block B and block C ($T_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given:* We are given the tension in string being pulled on ($T_3 = 65N$) and the mass of each block ($m_A = 12kg$, $m_B = 24kg$, $m_C = 31kg$). We are also told that the floor is horizontal which means it is level and that the floor is frictionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions:* Some things we need to assume that the strings are connected in the center of the blocks to prevent them from tipping over and that the strings will not break or come loose from the blocks. We also assume that the net force in the y direction is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution:* First, we will set up the equations and then we will explain how to enter it into the program. To do this problem, we need to look at the forces on each mass separately and write force equations for each mass in the horizontal direction (which we will call the x direction with positive point to the right). We only need to talk about the forces in the x direction because we are interested in how much the blocks accelerate in the x direction and the tension forces are solely in the x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Block A:  \n",
    "Since block A is on the end, in the x direction in its Free Body Diagram (FBD) the block only has the tension force going to the right. We write this force equation:  \n",
    "$(m_A)a = T_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Block B:  \n",
    "Since block B is in the middle of 2 blocks, in the x direction of its FBD there will be 2 tension forces going to the left and the right. The force going to the left is $T_1$ and the force going to the right is $T_2$. We write this force equation:  \n",
    "$(m_B)a = T_2 - T_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Block C:  \n",
    "Since block C is also in the middle of 2 blocks, it will have the same FBD with 2 tension forces going to the left and the right. The force going to the left is $T_2$ and the force going to the right is $T_3$. We write this force equation:  \n",
