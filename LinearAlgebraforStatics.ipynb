    "    I am to the cell that says REWRITE in header. Generally, I was in the process of incorporating the teaching of linear algebra into the first example and making the document more interactive by letting them try more things. More specifically, I was finishing up the first example and changing the last 2 code blocks of that section so it fit with what I have there now. After this fusion, I am done incorporating the teaching and the first example together. I also know I have to add the math to find each angle in the second example (statics example). I didnâ€™t have any other big plans for the document besides proofreading after this."

    "==============================\n",
    "In this notebook, you will be learning linear algebra and how to use code to solve a linear algebra tool called matrices. We can use linear algebra<sup>3</sup> to help solve common problems in physics and statics. Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that allows us to manipulate linear equations, equations with a single $x$ in comparison to $x^2$, with a technique called matrices. Linear Algebra is helpful to us, as a physicists and engineers, because we can solve for many unknowns at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also learn how to enter code in the coding language Python to solve systems of linear equations (linear systems) through matrices. We will teach you about the previously written code and how to change the code so it will solve any linear system. This notebook, is made up of a bunch of text and code cells, which you can decipher between them by \"`ln[#]:`\" on the left side of your screen which indicate it is a code cell. Here is an example of a code cell below. Place your cursor in the code cell and push shift+enter (that is shift and then enter) to execute the cell."

    "----------------\n",
    "This example<sup>1</sup> should look familiar from Workshop Physics I. We will walk you through this first problem:\n",
    "<img src=\"ex1physics.jpg\" alt=\"Physics Example 1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose:* The purpose of this problem is to find the acceleration of the system ($a$) and the tension in the string between block A and block B ($T_1$) and between block B and block C ($T_2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given:* We are given the tension in string being pulled on ($T_3 = 65N$) and the mass of each block ($m_A = 12kg$, $m_B = 24kg$, $m_C = 31kg$). We are also told that the floor is frictionless and is horizontal which means it is level.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions:* Some things we need to assume are the strings are connected in the center of the blocks to prevent them from tipping over and that the strings will not break or come loose from the blocks, that all of the blocks accelerate at the same value and that tension forces are solely in the x direction so we do not need to account for tension in the y direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution:* First, we will set up the equations and then we will explain how to enter it into the program. To do this problem, we need to look at the forces on each mass separately and write force equations for each mass in the x direction. We only need to work with the forces in the x direction because we assume the tension forces are solely in the x direction and we are only interested in how much the blocks accelerate in the x direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Block A:  \n",
    "Since block A is on the end, in the x direction in its Free Body Diagram (FBD) the block only has the tension force going to the right. We write this force equation and make this substitution:  \n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{}^{}F_xa &= T_1 \\\\\n",
    "(m_A)a &= T_1\n",
    "\\end{align} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Block B:  \n",
    "Since block B is in the middle of 2 blocks, in the x direction of its FBD there will be 2 tension forces, one going to the left and one to the right. The force going to the left is $T_1$ and the force going to the right is $T_2$. We write this force equation and make this substitution:  \n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{}^{}F_xb &= T_2 - T_1 \\\\\n",
    "(m_B)a &= T_2 - T_1\n",
    "\\end{align} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Block C:  \n",
    "Since block C is also in the middle of 2 blocks, it will have the same FBD as block b with 2 tension forces going to the left and the right. The force going to the left is $T_2$ and the force going to the right is $T_3$. We write this force equation and make this substitution:  \n",

    "(m_C)a &= T_3 - T_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align} $\n",

    "(12kg)a - T_1 &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "(24kg)a + T_1 - T_2 &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "(31kg)a + T_2 &= 65N \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; Linear Systems must be in this form to solve with Linear Algebra. Notice that the equations are organized with variables with their **coefficients on one side and constants on the other**. A coefficient is the number that come before the variable that multiply that specific variable, for example $(12kg)$ in $(12kg)a$ and $(24kg)$ in $(24kg)a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets learn how to enter our coefficients into code. We will enter the coefficients into the code in variables by assignment statements like we did with \"Hello, world\" but instead of assigning a string to a variable, we will assign a number to a variable. Here is the first 2 coefficients ($m_A$ and $m_B$) entered into the program below. Notice that we have entered the units of the coefficients as comments. This is helpful if we need to reference our code at a later date. Add $m_C$ and $T_3$ in the 2 blank lines under m_B."

Additionally, you will notice that the first column holds the a coefficient, the second the $T_1$ coefficient, and the third the $T_2$ coefficient and this format is continued for the entirety of the matrix. Then, the row is concluded by 0 which is the value of the constant. It is standard that the last column (the right most column) holds the constants to each equation.\n",

Brackets in python denotes a list and when there is a list inside of another list it is called a nested list. In our code, we will be transforming these nested lists into arrays. Arrays are similar to nested lists in the way that they contain lists but each list must be of the same length (so in tabular form it looks like a uniform rectangle without any sections missing) whereas lists inside of nested lists do not have to have the same length.\n",

We only saved the coefficients in the code if the values needed to be calculated so we must remember to place ones or negative ones in the other places the variables show up by themselves or 0 if they don't hold value in that equation.\n",

This specific condition will advance through a given value until it reaches the end.

    "The first line is another example of an assignment statement. You will see we access the numpy library again and use a method from linalg called lstsq. So, we will use the numpy library's routine called linalg to make changes to it by the lstsq method on the object of class numpy array. The general syntax is `library.routine.method()`. Lstsq stands for the least squares method and an example of a method buried in a routine from a library. A method is a collection of code that makes changes or refers to an object. The difference between methods and functions is purely in their purpose. Methods deal with objects while functions are more generally a collection of code that does anything. The lstsq method takes many parameters, including `coemat` and `vecmat`. The lstsq method also takes a number of optional parameters which are set to None automatically if not provided. We provided an example of this above when we set `rcond=None`. None in Python is like `null` in other programming languages. This method returns a list of useful data. For our purposes, the answer to the system is put in the first entry of the list. We access and print it on the next line by `sol[0]`. In lists and arrays we count each object starting at 0, which is why we have `sol[0]` written. So, we print to the screen `\"The answer is:\"`, `sol[0]` (the answer) and `Done`.\n",

    "Instead of solving each joint explicitly like you will be taught to do, we can leave the equations unsolved and put the equations in a system which decreases the amount of effort we need to put into the algebra. First though, we can solve for the $D_x$ and $C_x$, the direct distributed force from the wind, since they are simple to find. We find that $D_x = \\frac{(5/8)712lb}{2} = 133.5lb$, and $C_x = (5/8)712lb = 445lb$. There are also some forces that you can solve very simply (they are the only countering force in a certain direction) and I put in their values explicitly below.\n",
