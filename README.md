# LinearAlgebraforStatics
Motivation:
For students in a university level statics course to learn basic linear algebra to help them solve systems of linear equations.
We do this through a jupyter notebook and more specifically python.

Functionality:
Takes coefficient and "constant" matrices from a linear system and solves it via the numpy library.

Takes programmer input for the coefficients and constants and saves them to variables to use in the matrix
itself. The programmer will then write the coefficients and constants into the correct order in their
respective order in a regular array which will be "transformed" the into numpy arrays by the numpy library.

Finally, it uses the lstsq method from the linalg routine from the numpy library to solve the system. The
program prints each matrix, the answer and Done when the program executes.
